- title: Machine Learning Mushrooms
  description: >
    Training a neural network to classify various mushrooms
    as poisionous or edible. It's not practical in the least
    but I use it as a test bench for future machine learning
    projects, although my machine learning is on hiatus until
    I can get some more capable hardware.

- title: OpenGL Project
  description: >
    My first attempt at creating an OpenGL
    program. It just renders a cube to the
    screen with basic lighting and animation.
    It was a test to see if I could use OpenGL
    to experiment with shaders and computer
    graphics. I instead plan to use Unity to
    do those experiments

    My first videogame... it's not anything to write 
    home about. It serves as a testbench for learning 
    about different elements of game design

  description: >
    Generating tree-like graphics using a
    generative-algorithm known as an L-system.
    Here, an L-system generates a series of 
    commands for draw lines and dots on a screen.
