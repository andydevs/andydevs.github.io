  description: >
    My first attempt at creating an OpenGL
    program. It just renders a cube to the
    screen with basic lighting and animation.
    It was a test to see if I could use OpenGL
    to experiment with shaders and computer
    graphics. I instead plan to use Unity to
    do those experiments
