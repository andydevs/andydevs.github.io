- title: Robot Trump
  description: >
    This project trains a recurrent neural network
    to generate new tweets from Donald Trump using
    a dataset of archived Donald Trump tweets. I've
    also developed a hyperparameter tuning system
    using Bayesian optimization to optimize the 
    network for the best performance.

- title: OpenGL Project
  image: images/opengl-project.png
  description: >
    My first attempt at creating an OpenGL
    program. It just renders a cube to the
    screen with basic lighting and animation.
    It was a test to see if I could use OpenGL
    to experiment with shaders and computer
    graphics. I instead plan to use Unity to
    do those experiments

    My first videogame... it's not anything to write 
    home about. It serves as a testbench for learning 
    about different elements of game design

  description: >
    Generating tree-like graphics using a
    generative-algorithm known as an L-system.
    Here, an L-system generates a series of 
    commands for draw lines and dots on a screen.
